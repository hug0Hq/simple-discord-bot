# verry-simple-discorbot

I made this Bot in a couple of hours just to try out the Discord API.

The project is **not stable**, and it have some lazy coding on it.

The Bot should be capable of have a sound board, an image gallery and text quotes, all the functionality is managed inside discord no website needed.
